classes in python are used to define other data types besides the usual ones
an object refers to one instance in a class
each object can have different attributes
methods can also be objects


general syntax: 
	class ClassName

to create an instance for an object:
	instance1 = ClassName()
	instance1.x = 10
	instance2.y = 20 etc


#Good code practice
to ensure code is neat, don't flood it with too many comments
use lower case letters for variable names and underscores to separate multiple_words
for classes, use CamelCase to define names and lower case letters to define instances.
