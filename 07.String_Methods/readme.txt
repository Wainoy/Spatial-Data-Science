string_methods.py demonstrates a few string methods
Methods are functions that are specific to particular objects. A period (.) is used to access them.
The len() function can be used to find the length of a string (number of characters). 
General syntax: 
	string_name.method()

Example: string_name.find(), replace(), upper(), lower(), etc
in() operator can be used to check for containment.
