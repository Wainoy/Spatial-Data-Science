functions.py

to define a function, one word should be used as function name. separate more words using underscores
to call a function, you have to define it first
if you define parameters for a function, you should always supply the arguments
positional arguments change with position. with keyword arguments, position doesn't quite matter.
keyword arguments improve the readability of your code. they're especially suitable for situations where you have multiple numeric arguments that you need to pass.
keyword arguments should always come before positional arguments
